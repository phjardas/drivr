  **NOTE:** This is a template for index.html. It uses ejs and htmlWebpackPlugin to generate a different index.html for each environment. htmlWebpackPlugin will dynamically add references to the scripts and styles that it bundles to this file. The generated bundles have hash-based filenames, so it's necessary to add the references dynamically.
  For more info on ejs, see http://www.embeddedjs.com/. For examples of using it with htmlWebpackPlugin, see https://github.com/jaketrent/html-webpack-template/blob/master/index.ejs

    The htmlWebpackPlugin will parse the logic below so that trackJS is only added to the production version of index.html (since only webpack.config.prod.js provides the trackJS token)
